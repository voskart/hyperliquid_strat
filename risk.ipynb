    "When it comes to systematic risk, or market risk, we cannot reduce this risk by diversifying our portfolio. Given that our strategy is market-neutral, the risk is somewhat reduced as in the case of the overall market breakdown, we would still be hedged on the downside. \n",

    "Ideally, we should also stay within limits as defined via our risk framework. One could be as detailed as needed, e.g., having DeFi vs CeFi limits, counterparty limits as well as limits for specific assets. Given that we are currently focusing on DeFi, we will not take CeFi limits into consideration. Instead, we can focus on couterparty limits, asset exposure limits as well as strategy-specific limits, e.g., trend-following, mean-reversion, or, as we have here, pair-trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Counterparty Limit: There will be a counterparty limit for the exchange that we are trading on. It is imperative to spread assets across exchanges where possible so that in case of unforeseen events, one would not lose the whole portfolio value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Strategy Limit: Generally speaking, since we are always long an asset and short another one at the same time, the limits for that specific strategy could be higher when comparing to others where we do not have a direct hedge. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Asset Limit: We should also have limits for the respective assets after they have undergone a review. Since we are not always short a particular asset as we are either long/short the spread, there will be instances where we are potentially longing a \"bad\" asset. In our example this is not the case but there are instances where we could set up a pair trade with a currency that is for example heavily controlled/could be manipulated as it has happened over the summer (TRB for example). While one cannot completely eliminate this risk, one can at least review the assets at hand and also monitor when large on-chain deposits onto exchanges happen. This would mitigate the risk of potential funding rate fluctuations/correlation breakdowns in the case of manipulations.\n",
