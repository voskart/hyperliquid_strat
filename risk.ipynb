    "When it comes to systematic risk, or market risk, we cannot reduce this risk by diversifying our portfolio. Given that our strategy is market-neutral, the risk is somewhat reduced as in the case of the overall market breakdown, we would still be hedged on the downside. \n",

    "* Asset Limit: We should also have limits for the respective assets after they have undergone a review. Since we are not always short a particular asset as we are either long/short the spread, there will be instances where we are potentially longing a \"bad\" asset. In our example this is not the case but there are instances where we could set up a pair trade with a currency that is for example heavily controlled/could be manipulated as it has happened over the summer (TRB for example). While one cannot completely eliminate this risk, one can at least review the assets at hand and also monitor when large on-chain deposits onto exchanges happen.
